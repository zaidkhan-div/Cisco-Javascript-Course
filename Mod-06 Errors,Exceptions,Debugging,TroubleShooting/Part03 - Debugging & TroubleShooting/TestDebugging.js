// Debugging
// To be conducted efficiently, debugging requires tools, and if our code is executed in the browser, we almost certainly have all the necessary tools already available.

// To check if our browser supports this functionality, we can simply try to execute this code with the developer console opened.

console.log("Before debugger");
debugger;
console.log("After debugger");
