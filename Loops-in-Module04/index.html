        In programming, loops are the second form of flow control statement. Together with conditional execution
        statements like if and switch, they allow for almost infinite freedom in how the application can work from an
        algorithmic point of view. While conditional statements are able to change code behavior (allowing us to decide
        during program execution whether a certain piece of code is to be performed or not), loops are an easy way to
        repeat any fragment of the code as many times as we want, or until some condition is met. There are a few types
        of loops in JavaScript, but we can loosely split them into two categories:

        loops that are repeated a given number of times;
        loops that continue until some condition is met.
